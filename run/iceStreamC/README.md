# Simulations to investigate the temporal development of drainage on Kamb Ice Stream
This directory contains the simulations for Section 4.2 and Figure 3 in *Elsworth and Suckale* (2016) to determine the role of hydrology on the sequential stagnation of Kamb Ice Stream. The northern margin of Kamb Ice Stream has been found to have rapidly migrated inwards before the complete stagnation of the ice stream [*Catania et al., 2006*]. In order to match observed discontinuous shear margin migration, we find that a concentrated strengthening of the bed occurs at the hydropotential low inside to the ice stream. Assuming the presence of efficient drainage in this region, we can connect these best fitting basal strength profiles to the relative contribution of efficient and distributed meltwater drainage. We find that in time an increase in discharge occurs through an efficient drainage element at the hydropotential low, while the distributed system becomes less well-connected.
