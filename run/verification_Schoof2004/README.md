# Verification of the code developed in *Elsworth and Suckale* (2016) against the analytical solution of *Schoof* (2004)
We compare our numerical solution of the margin tracking algorithm to the analytical solution developed by *Schoof* (2004). The analytical solution assumes a Newtonian ice rheology and solves for the margin location consistent with the force balance. Figures 3(a1), 3(a2) and 3(a3) in *Schoof* (2004) show the assumed basal strength profiles, determined shear margin location and basal stress. The algorithm developed in *Elsworth and Suckale* (2016) recovers the same margin position and basal strength profile as the analytical solution and is therefore verified for a Newtonian rheology. The inclusion of a non-Newtonian rheology does not change the solution technique, which suggests that it remains verified for a non-Newtonian constitutive law.
